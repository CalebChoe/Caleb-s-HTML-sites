<h2 style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Below is a paragraph on Python vs C.</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 15px" align="center">Although Python and C are both object-oriented programing languages, both have many differences. Python uses compiling and interpretation to read the machine code, so that it can start executing the code. C requires the coder making their own space and many things must be created by type, unlike python which has many "assisted" features hard-driven into the language. Python is slower due to more pre-made features. Both have ups and downs, and in the end, Python is easier to code, but C is faster. Coders have 2 great options.</p>
